STRATEGY 1
methodology involves sending getaddr messages recursively to find all the reachable nodes in the network, starting from a set of seed nodes

STRATEGY 2
Get list of nodes from BITNODES
Construct connections
- getpeers from each node in the list ?
  - repeat multiple times? each request might return different nodes
- Can we use data propagation data?

ALGORITHM
1) Get nodes from Bitnodes
2) Add nodes to G
3) For each node in G
  3.1) Connect; Ask peers (getaddr)
  3.2) For each received addr
        3.2.1) If addr not in G
          - add addr to G
        3.2.2) Add edge (node-peer)
