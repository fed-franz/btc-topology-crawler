STRATEGY 1
methodology involves sending getaddr messages recursively to find all the reachable nodes in the network, starting from a set of seed nodes

STRATEGY 2
Get list of nodes from BITNODES
Construct connections
- getpeers from each node in the list ?
  - repeat multiple times? each request might return different nodes
- Can we use data propagation data?
